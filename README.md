Import from LMS to Haiku
------------------------

Goals to accomplish:

- Existing user accounts stay active and as they are 
- Users sign in using their google account credentials (perhaps existing users continue to use local login option at login screen)  
- How do we merge existing users to be google apps users?
- Data imported….
  	-  User name login etc
	-  Student year group and classes (timetable)  basically what subjects are on a students timetable (we need to be able to have groups of students by year group and classes)  Using the codes we have in TASS  e.g. 11ENGA  11ENGB  etc etc
	-  Teacher timetable (subjects taught / timetable)  
	-  We need to be able to have data within the groups option when creating a roster for a class….  For example all year 8 students or all year 8 English A students….  Or all Year 8 English students (class a,b,c,d,e)
